        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl font-base mt-5">
          HearWear is an innovative project designed to revolutionize
          communication for individuals with partial hearing loss. It functions
          both as a hearing aid and a real-time language translator, all
          operated seamlessly through in-ear devices such as earbuds or
          earphones. By enhancing ambient sounds and converting speech into
          amplified, clearer audio, HearWear aids those with partial deafness in
          better understanding their surroundings. Simultaneously, its built-in
          live translation feature allows users to break language barriers,
          making conversations across different languages more accessible.
          Compact, user-friendly, and smart, HearWear offers a discreet yet
          powerful solution for inclusive communication in todayâ€™s connected
          world.
